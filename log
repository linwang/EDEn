TileEngine now holds a Pathfinder instance that holds a reference to a Map resource, instead of the Map owning a Pathfinder and keeping its state beyond the duration of the TileEngine.

1) Making TileEngine use Pathfinder instead of Map, and  adding helper functions to Pathfinder to prevent TileEngine code from needing to know too much about Pathfinder's inner data.

2) Made NPC and NPC::MoveOrder take a Pathfinder instead of a Map.

3) Made Map more of a const, stateless class (though the step function needs to still be removed).

At this point, the Pathfinder class is a bit big and should be broken apart. However, the new functionality works, so I'm fine with calling the pathfinding branch a success and integrating it in.
