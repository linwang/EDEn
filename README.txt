EDEn README
====================

EDEn (the Exodus Draconis Engine) is a free and open-source engine used to create top-down, 2D RPGs with 3D effects. Aside from the usual trimmings one would expect from the genre, the engine aims to also enable some gameplay elements typically found in adventure games.

The initial purpose of this engine was to facilitate the creation of a very specific game (Exodus Draconis, for which the engine is named). While development of the game continues, the engine will contain common code and utilities created along the way that may aid in the development of other RPGs.

EDEn is programmed in C++ and uses SDL for graphics and audio. By exposing C++ functionality as a Lua API, EDEn allows game developers to develop and tweak gameplay, quests and stories on the fly without requiring the source to be recompiled. The engine can also handle a variety of image and audio assets supported by SDL_image and SDL_mixer, respectively.

In general, EDEn aims to help game designers quickly turn RPG stories, gameplay and level designs into playable RPGs.
